# Security Considerations for MonTip

This document outlines important security considerations for the MonTip platform.

## Smart Contract Security

The MonTip contract (`0x575b42faBddE672379FBe67D0fb25DCaA8432061`) implements several security measures:

1. **Reentrancy Protection**: Uses OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy attacks on sensitive functions.

2. **Access Control**: Implements `Ownable` pattern to restrict administrative functions to the contract owner.

3. **Emergency Mechanism**: Includes emergency withdrawal functionality with a 24-hour time lock to ensure funds can be recovered in extreme cases.

4. **Input Validation**: Enforces strict input validation for all user inputs (usernames, descriptions, messages) with maximum length limits.

5. **Pausability**: Contract can be paused in case of emergency using OpenZeppelin's `Pausable` contract.

## Frontend Security Considerations

1. **Connection Security**: 
   - Always connect through HTTPS
   - Validate wallet connection is on the correct Monad network
   - Show clear confirmation messages for all transactions

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs client-side before sending transactions
   - Sanitize user-generated content to prevent XSS

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Gracefully handle contract errors and display user-friendly messages
   - Log errors for debugging but don't expose sensitive information

## User Recommendations

1. **Wallet Security**:
   - Never share your private keys or seed phrases
   - Use a hardware wallet for additional security
   - Verify transaction details before confirming

2. **Safe Practices**:
   - Test with small amounts first
   - Be cautious of phishing attempts
   - Bookmark the official MonTip website

3. **Recovery Options**:
   - Keep your recovery phrase in a secure location
   - Have a backup wallet setup

## Audits

The MonTip smart contract is currently operating on the Monad Testnet and has not yet undergone a formal security audit. A full audit will be completed before mainnet deployment.
